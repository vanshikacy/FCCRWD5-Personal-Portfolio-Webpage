# FCC Responsive Web Design Projects

Cleaned up my old projects from the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification.  
All five are built with plain HTML and CSS â€” focused on structure, responsiveness, and passing all FCC test cases.

## Project

### 5. Personal Portfolio Page
A starter personal portfolio with links and placeholder content. Responsive layout.

## Notes

- Built from scratch, without frameworks or libraries.
- No JavaScript.
- Each project passes all FreeCodeCamp RWD test cases.
- Mostly just for practice & to keep things organized on GitHub.
